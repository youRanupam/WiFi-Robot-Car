# WiFi-Robot-Car
WiFi-Based Mobile Controlled Robot Car built using Arduino, ESP8266 WiFi module, and L298N motor driver. The system enables real-time wireless control of the robot via a mobile interface. Motor stability issues were resolved using PWM-based speed calibration for straight-line motion accuracy.
